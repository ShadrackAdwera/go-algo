Data structures &amp; Algorithms refresher

## Warm up

- This package contains common problem solving techniques : frequency counter, multiple pointers, sliding window, divide & conquer.

1. Frequency Counter
   - the function should accept two slices of type int and return true if
     every value in the slice has its corresponding value squared in the second slice ps
     the frequency of values must be the same.
2. Multiple Pointers
   - function accepts a sorted slice and counts unique values in the slice
